Cấu trúc sử dụng là as .... as


S + V + as + {adj/ adv} + as + {noun/ pronoun}

ex:

My book is as interesting as yours. 
His car runs as fast as a race car. 
John sings as well as his sister. 
Their house is as big as that one. 
His job is not as difficult as mine. 
They are as lucky as we.

Nếu là câu phủ định, as thứ nhất có thể thay bằng so. He is not as tall as his father.
He is not so tall as his father.
Sau as phải là một đại từ nhân xưng chủ ngữ, không được là một đại từ tân ngữ. Peter is as tall as I. (đÚNG)
Peter is as tall as me. (SAI)

Danh từ cũng có thể được dùng để so sánh, nhưng nên nhớ trước khi so sánh phải đảm bảo rằng danh từ đó phải có các tính từ tương đương.

adjectives	nouns
 
heavy, light	weight
wide, narrow	width
deep, shallow	depth
long, short	length
big, small	size

Khi so sánh bằng danh từ, sử dụng cấu trúc sau:

S + V + the same + (noun) + as + {noun/pronoun}

My house is as high as his.
My house is the same height as his.

Chú ý rằng ngược nghĩa với the same...as là different from... Không bao giờ dùng
different than. Sau đây là một số ví dụ khác về so sánh bằng danh từ.

These trees are the same as those.
He speaks the same language as she. 
Her address is the same as Rita’s. 
Their teacher is different from ours.
She takes the same course as her husband.
